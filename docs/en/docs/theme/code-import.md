## vue component import

:::tip
By default, the theme registers the `.vue` components under `/.vuepress/vue-previews` globally, so the components that need to be previewed should be placed in this directory.

If our documentation project is stored in a subdirectory of the project, such as the `/docs` folder, we need to set `themeConfig.vuePreviewsDir` to `./docs/.vuepress/vue-previews`.
